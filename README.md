# Bangumi

This is my first React.js project after watching a React tutorial on Udemy. I created it primary for practicing React, and secondary for my personal uses. The code quality will be really bad before v1.0, mixing with test codes, codes may never be used, and codes that did not optimized for performance.

This app is highly base on [bangumi-data](https://github.com/bangumi-data/bangumi-data) and [bangumi-api](https://github.com/bangumi/api). Although I expect this to be a long-term project, and I will keep working on it until all the features that I want are implemented to this app and all the bugs are fixed, but this app may die when bangumi-data is deprecated, unless I can find another data source.

> :warning: This app is fully in Chinese, because the data sources that I am using are in Chinese. English version may or may not implemented in the future.

# Planning Features

- View anime list from any seasons in the past, or currently on air.

- Favoring anime to have fast access of its information.
